-- Room Booking App — Supabase schema (authoritative)
-- Run in Supabase Dashboard -> SQL Editor -> New query.
--
-- This file supersedes the original schema.sql plus migrations 002-004.
-- It is IDEMPOTENT: safe to run against the live database as-is. Policies
-- are dropped before being recreated, functions use CREATE OR REPLACE, and
-- the realtime publication is added conditionally.
--
-- IT DOES NOT DESTROY DATA. There is no DROP TABLE anywhere in this file.
--
-- Maintenance rule: if you change something in the SQL editor, change it
-- HERE too. Three separate security problems in this system went unnoticed
-- for months purely because the live database and this file had drifted —
-- release_own_booking existed only in the database and so was never
-- reviewed, and it turned out to let anyone extend any booking.
--
-- Last hardening pass (see sections 2, 3, 6, 7, 8):
--   - The three "Admins can ..." policies were unconditional against the
--     `authenticated` role. Now gated on public.is_admin(). Section 2.
--   - pg_temp added to search_path on every SECURITY DEFINER function.
--   - Section 12 gained checks for both of the above, plus a view check.
--   - Section 13 records reviewed-but-unapplied items.

-- Creation timestamp. NULLABLE on purpose: rows created before this column

-- escaping, so an anonymous user could insert a row whose id contained a quote
-- mark plus JavaScript and have it execute in the admin's browser, with the
-- admin's session. genId() in js/utils/ids.js only ever emits [a-z0-9], and
-- legacy ids are alphanumeric, so nothing legitimate is excluded.

-- Anyone with the publishable key can read every booking. This is what makes
-- the public status board work.
--
-- KNOWN EXPOSURE, accepted: booked_by, purpose, room and date are therefore
-- world-readable to anyone who has the key, and the key is in the page
-- source. Do not put anything confidential in `purpose`.
--
-- PARTIALLY MITIGATED by the restrictive policy immediately below, which
-- limits anon to Pending and Confirmed rows. Rejected and cancelled history
-- is no longer readable. ACTIVE bookings are still fully exposed, because the
-- unauthenticated UI renders booked_by in three places — status grid,
-- timeline and the 60-day schedule. Closing that needs a product decision,
-- not a policy change.
create policy "Public can view bookings"
  on public.bookings for select
  using (true);

-- Narrows the policy above for unauthenticated callers.
--
-- RESTRICTIVE policies AND with the permissive ones rather than OR-ing, so
-- this subtracts from `using (true)` without replacing it. Rejected and
-- Cancelled rows stop being readable through the API.
--
-- WHY: rejected requests are the most sensitive slice of the exposure noted
-- above. "X asked for this room on this date and was refused" is information
-- nobody chose to publish, and the key that reads it is in the page source.
-- Hiding them in the admin UI does nothing about the API.
--
-- WHY auth.role() AND NOT public.is_admin(): is_admin() is revoked from anon
-- (see section 2), so calling it in a policy that anon evaluates raises a
-- permission error on EVERY public SELECT and takes the whole app down.
-- auth.role() is callable by anon. Only the admin can hold the authenticated
-- role here: signups are disabled and the three admin policies below are
-- gated on is_admin().
--
-- WHY the authenticated clause is needed at all: a policy with no explicit
-- role, or `to public`, applies to the PUBLIC pseudo-role, of which EVERY
-- role is a member — including authenticated. Without it this would hide
-- rejected bookings from the ADMIN too and break the "Show rejected" toggle
-- in the admin table, because admin reads go through the permissive policy
-- above rather than a SELECT policy of their own.
--
-- SAFE because nothing in the public UI needs these rows: findAllConflicts()
-- already skips Rejected and Cancelled, the status grid and timeline render
-- Confirmed only, and cancel_own_booking() / release_own_booking() are
-- SECURITY DEFINER and bypass RLS entirely.
drop policy if exists "Public sees only active bookings" on public.bookings;
create policy "Public sees only active bookings"
  on public.bookings as restrictive for select
  to public
  using (
    status in ('Pending','Confirmed')
    or auth.role() = 'authenticated'

-- Anyone can create a booking REQUEST, but it must land as Pending.
-- Confirmed bookings are only ever created by a logged-in admin.

  with check (
    status = 'Pending'
    and conflict_resolved = false
    and (conflict_note is null or conflict_note = '')
    -- No backdating from the public form. The client refuses too, but that is
    -- UX only: anyone can POST here directly with the publishable key.
    --
    -- Admins are unaffected. This policy applies to the `public` role for
    -- INSERT, while admin inserts go through "Admins can insert any booking";
    -- multiple PERMISSIVE policies OR together, so satisfying the admin one is
    -- enough. Admins may backdate, with a confirmation prompt in the form.
    --
    -- current_date is UTC and IST is ahead of it, so a booking for "today" in
    -- local terms always satisfies this. The comparison is lenient by exactly
    -- the timezone offset, never strict.

  );

-- Identity check for the three admin policies below.
--
-- These policies previously used `using (true)` / `with check (true)` against
-- the `authenticated` role. Postgres ignores policy NAMES, so despite being
-- called "Admins can ...", ANY authenticated session had full insert, update
-- and delete on every booking. The only thing preventing that was signups
-- being disabled in the Supabase dashboard — a single control, living in a UI
-- rather than in this file, that nobody was reviewing.
--
-- Two independent controls now: dashboard signups disabled stops accounts
-- being created, and this stops a created account from doing anything.
--
-- Keep this address in step with ADMIN_EMAIL in js/config.js. Changing the
-- admin requires editing BOTH. Pinning to auth.uid() instead would survive an
-- email change, but email keeps the two files legible side by side.

-- 3. SELF-SERVICE CANCEL / RELEASE (SECURITY DEFINER RPCs)
-- ============================================================
-- These are the ONLY way an anonymous caller can modify a row. Both run as

-- boundary — the client-side name check in cancel-release.js is a UX nicety.
--
-- On `set search_path = public, pg_temp` (used on every SECURITY DEFINER
-- function in this file): naming pg_temp explicitly is required, not
-- cosmetic. If it is omitted, Postgres searches the temp schema FIRST for
-- relation names, and TEMPORARY is granted to PUBLIC by default — so a caller
-- can create a temp table named `bookings` and have a definer function
-- operate on theirs instead of the real one. Keep it on every definer
-- function added here.
--
-- KNOWN WEAKNESS, accepted: the identity check compares the typed name
-- against booked_by, but booked_by is world-readable via the SELECT policy
-- above. Anyone can read a name and then cancel or shorten that booking.
-- This prevents accidents, not deliberate misuse. Closing it properly needs
-- a per-booking token issued at creation time and required here.

-- bookings_archive is created, and never tracks later changes. created_at was

-- rotate the address inside it, so counting exact addresses gives one attacker
-- unlimited identities. A /64 is normally one household or one handset, so

--
-- HONEST LIMITATION: these headers are ultimately client-influenced. This

-- 12b. SCHEDULED JOBS (pg_cron)
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- Not created by this file, because pg_cron lives outside the public schema
-- and re-running schema.sql should not silently reschedule infrastructure.
-- Recorded here so it is not rediscovered from scratch — the whole reason
-- three security problems went unnoticed for months was state existing in
-- the database and nowhere else.
--
--   Job name : archive-old-bookings-daily
--   Schedule : 30 21 * * *   (21:30 UTC = 03:00 IST next day)
--   Command  : select public.archive_old_bookings(90)
--   Created  : setup_daily_archive.sql
--
-- Effect: bookings whose booking_date is more than 90 days past, and whose
-- status is not 'Pending', move from public.bookings to
-- public.bookings_archive. Future bookings are untouched — a future date can
-- never satisfy `booking_date < current_date - 90`.
--
-- CONSEQUENCE, deliberate: public.bookings holds a rolling ~90-day window,
-- so the admin table, search and Excel export only ever show that window.
-- Anything older is queryable in SQL only; there is no UI for the archive.
-- Utilisation or trend analysis must UNION both tables.
--
-- CONSEQUENCE, unhandled: Pending requests are never archived, at any age.
-- A request nobody answered stays in public.bookings indefinitely. Left
-- alone on purpose — auto-rejecting someone's request is a policy decision,
-- not a cron job's call.
--
-- Health check:
--   select jobname, schedule, active from cron.job;
--   select status, return_message, start_time from cron.job_run_details
--   where jobid = (select jobid from cron.job where jobname = 'archive-old-bookings-daily')
--   order by start_time desc limit 5;
--
-- To remove:  select cron.unschedule('archive-old-bookings-daily');
-- ============================================================


-- ============================================================
-- 12c. REPORTING VIEWS
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- The daily archive job keeps public.bookings to a rolling ~90 days, so any
-- trend question asked against that table silently answers from three months
-- of data. These present live + archive as one dataset for analysis.
--
-- security_invoker = true is NOT OPTIONAL. On Postgres 15+ a view runs with
-- its OWNER's privileges and bypasses RLS on the underlying tables entirely —
-- without this, bookings_all would hand anon a way around every policy in
-- section 2, including the restrictive one that hides rejected bookings.
--
-- The revokes are also NOT optional. Supabase sets default privileges on the
-- public schema, so a new view is granted to anon AND authenticated the moment
-- it exists. "I did not grant it" is not the same as "it is not granted".
--
-- Columns are named rather than `select *`: positional matching between the
-- two tables breaks silently the moment they drift.
--
-- To remove: drop room_utilisation_monthly FIRST (it depends on bookings_all).

-- 13. OPEN ITEMS — reviewed, not yet applied
-- ============================================================
-- Recorded here so they are not rediscovered from scratch. None are
-- exploitable as they stand. Applying any of them means changing the live
-- database AND this file in the same sitting.
--
-- b) RETRACTED. An earlier note here claimed enforce_room_capacity was
--    coupled to the public SELECT policy because it is SECURITY INVOKER.
--    That was wrong: the function body reads no tables at all — only
--    new.room, new.attendees and a CASE expression. There is nothing for RLS
--    to filter, so SECURITY INVOKER is correct and no change is needed. It
--    does still duplicate the seat counts from js/config.js ROOMS; keep the
--    two in step.
--
-- c) base36_to_bigint has no length guard. It is anon-callable and multiplies
--    without bound, so a long input raises a bigint overflow instead of
--    returning null the way a bad character does. No security impact, but it
--    is an unhandled exception reachable by anyone. Return null above ~12
--    characters.
--
-- d) The app still derives creation time by decoding booking ids
--    (js/utils/ids.js creationMs) rather than reading created_at, which now
--    exists and is backfilled. Switching over is a small change in
--    supabase-client.js and filters-sort.js, after which creationMs can go.
